# Warmupcode

Hello there, in a bid to revive my skills in design and code, I decided to spend my weekend designing a landing page + coding it.
As a warm up, I decided to follow along on Youtube, but then added my own flavour of a landing page I desired.

Truth be told, it's not perfect; I came across a few obstacles here and there, but it's okay. I'll make some time to rectify my code and improve on my coding, and not forgetting my design skills too.
